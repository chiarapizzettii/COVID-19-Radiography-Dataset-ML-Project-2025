# COVID-19-Radiography-Dataset-ML-Project-2025
Deep learning model used to classify chest X-ray images into COVID, Normal, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia categories, based on the COVID-19 Radiography Database.

## **Dataset** ##
The project utilizes the widely recognized **COVID-19 Radiography Database**, which is automatically managed via `kagglehub`.

**Class Distribution:**
- **Normal:** 10,192 images
- **Lung Opacity:** 6,012 images
- **COVID:** 3,616 images
- **Viral Pneumonia:** 1,345 images
- **Total:** 21,165 X-ray images
The dataset exhibits a clear class imbalance (with the Normal class being the most prevalent), which is addressed during the data processing and training phases.

## **Project Pipeline** ##
**1. Dataset Setup:** Automatic download and directory restructuring to ensure compatibility with data generators (flattening nested subfolders).

**2. Preprocessing:** Removal of segmentation masks to focus exclusively on the radiography images for classification.

**3. Data Augmentation:** Applying transformations like rotations, zooms, and flips to enhance model generalization.

**4. Model Architecture:** The notebook implements a deep neural network (e.g., ResNet50 or similar) using Transfer Learning to leverage pre-trained weights.

**5. Training & Validation:** Optimization of hyperparameters and monitoring metrics such as Accuracy and Loss.

**6. Evaluation:** Performance assessment using a Confusion Matrix and visualization of model predictions.

## **Technology Used**
- **Python**
- **PyTorch / Torchvision**
- **KaggleHub** (for dataset management)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas & OS** (for data handling)

## **Results** ##
The model effectively distinguishes viral pneumonia and COVID-19 from healthy lungs or other opacities. Detailed metrics and visualization of predictions (including horizontal bar charts of class probabilities) are included at the end of the notebook.
